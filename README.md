# p2p-chat

This is an extremely small peer-to-peer (P2P) group chat implementation.
The application is pure P2P because there is no distinction between servers and clients.
All participants are called "nodes", where each node
is an instance of the program (`src/node.py`).

## Dependency

Python >= 3.9

## Usage
